# Cortex

**The default starter brain for Taskade Genesis.**

Fork this repo. Import into Taskade. Get a fully wired AI workspace in 60 seconds — 5 agents, 10 projects, 6 automations, 1 app — all connected and running.

> Cortex is not a sample app. It is a working brain. You don't learn it. You use it. Then you make it yours.

## What's Inside

### Intelligence — 5 Agents

| Agent | Role | Emoji |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Strategist** | Think in tradeoffs, answer in options | ♟ |
| **Editor** | Cut 30%, keep the nerve | ✂ |
| **Researcher** | Find primary sources, cite everything | 🔍 |
| **Critic** | Argue against whatever you just said | ⚖ |
| **Builder** | Spec it, scope it, ship it | 🛠 |

### Memory — 10 Projects

- **Company Context** — who you are, what you sell, how you talk
- **Decision Log** — every major call, reasoning, outcome
- **5 Playbooks** — Hiring, Launch, Pricing, Fundraise, Support
- **2 Libraries** — Mental Models & Frameworks, References
- **Welcome** — onboarding guide to Cortex itself

### Reflexes — 6 Automations

- **Daily Standup** — morning cron that pulls tasks and summarizes blockers
- **Decision Council** — webhook triggers 3 agents to debate and synthesize
- **Weekly Review** — Friday evening scores the week and plans the next
- **Inbox Triage** — classifies incoming messages and routes to the right agent
- **Incident Response** — assembles a team and creates a war room
- **Monday Planning** — reviews goals and seeds the week's priorities

### Interface — 1 Genesis App

A multi-route React SPA with dashboard, council, journal, and library views — all wired to the agents and projects above.

## Quick Start

### Option A: Fork and Import (recommended)

1. **Fork** this repo
2. Go to your Taskade workspace
3. **Import** → select `cortex.tsk` (or point at your fork's URL)
4. All 5 agents, 10 projects, 6 automations, and the app appear — wired and running

### Option B: Clone and Customize

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taskade/cortex.git
cd cortex
npm install
```

Edit any JSON file under `agents/`, `projects/`, `automations/`, or `apps/`.

```bash
npm run validate    # Check structural integrity
npm run summary     # Print artifact counts and IDs
npm run assemble    # Build cortex.tsk bundle
```

Then import the generated `cortex.tsk` into Taskade.

## Customization

Every JSON file is a standalone artifact. Swap any of them:

- **Replace an agent** — copy `agents/_template.json`, write your persona prompt, delete the old one
- **Add a project** — copy `projects/_template.json`, structure your content, save
- **Modify a flow** — edit trigger/action pairs in `automations/*.json`
- **Redesign the app** — edit the FileSystemTree in `apps/cortex.json`

See [docs/FORK-AND-CUSTOMIZE.md](docs/FORK-AND-CUSTOMIZE.md) for a step-by-step guide.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run validate` | Structural integrity checks on all JSON artifacts |
| `npm run summary` | Print artifact counts and IDs |
| `npm run assemble` | Build `dist/workspace.json` + `cortex.tsk` |
| `npm run ci` | Run summary + validate (used in GitHub Actions) |
